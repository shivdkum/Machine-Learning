Projects and assignments in Machine Learning

>>Implemented different classifies like Decision trees, Linear perceptrons, SVM, ANN, Naive Bayes using R language to predict if the patient have diabetes based on IRIS data set found UCI website.
>>The dataset had 150 instances and 4 attributes.
>> Preprocessing of dataset involved scaling the data. Analysis was made by changes different parameter for each of the classifiers and finally achieved 98% accuracy on SVM and ANN classifiers.
